Welcome to the blog page, where you can find all the blogs that have been created and displayed here, sorted by months. The blog uses information from the database on phpMyAdmin to fill the blog with data. This functionality relies on the use of Xampp.

This is the page where you can create a blog by inputting the title and content.
## Add Post Page 
When you hit submit, your post goes live on the blog and gets saved to the database. The system automatically tracks when each post was made, so you can see the timeline on the blog. There's also a handy filter that lets you browse posts by month - it pulls the date information and sorts everything using PHP.
